Variables:

Dataset size: number of columns

Dataset distribution: column length distribution

threshold

query column

## Benchmark 1 
Goal: Measure scalability of different methods

Variable: 
the size of datasets. size: 400, 4000, 40000, 400000

Fix:
threshold = 0.6
query column = median length one

Output:
Runtime,
precision, recall, f1

## Benchmark 2
Goal: Measure the effect of threshold

Variable:
threshold: 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9

Fix:
dataset size = 10000

Output:
Runtime,
precision, recall, f1

## Benchmark 3
Goal: Measure the effect of query column

Variable:
query column = small col, median col, large col

Fix:
dataset size = 10000
threshold = 0.6

Output:
Runtime,
precision, recall, f1
